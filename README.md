# About:
Uploading a whole bunch of setup on a server has always been expensive which takes lot of time, effort and bandwidth, especaially when using a bulky framework. Especially for me when uploading projects to shared server without CLI/Shell access would force me to upload the entire setup to the server. SDP helps in saving time & energy facilitating you to upload a zip archive of your project and helps in deploying them by unzipping them on your server.

# Procedure:

  - Upload the deploy.php to your server location.
  - Upload the zip archive of your project to the server location.
  - Open browser and browse the deploy.php
  - Select the zip package that needs to be deployed (Supports multiple packages)
  - Re-confirm after through validation and click on deploy.
